- **Filing Retrieval**: Fetch 10-K and 10-Q filings from SEC EDGAR database
- **Data Extraction**: Extract proved reserves and production data from filings
- **Reserve Life Analysis**: Calculate and visualize reserve life trends over time

## Quick Start

```console
git clone https://github.com/cfgackstatter/reserve-life.git
cd reserve-life
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the app**
